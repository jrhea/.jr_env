# wherever you go there you are

this is an attempt to create some consistency in the different *nix environments i work in.
i have organized the files that I will dist into these categories:

## how to use this environment

1. clone the repo 

  $ git clone https://github.com/jrhea/.jr_env.git

2. run init script
  
  $ source ~/.jr_env/init.env
  
## project structure

* config: settings files (e.g. .bashrc, .cshrc, .conf files)

* utils: code/scripts i use regularly, or that i just don't want to lose
